# Code Kata word wrap
This is my worked example from the 33rd meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. The code uses a very clean and simple LISP to JavaScript compiler called [Sibilant](http://sibilantjs.info/), I've used this together with [TAP](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap) (the Test-Anything Protocol).

You can run the tests with:

```bash
    make clean test
```

The source of the kata is Robert C. Martin (@UncleBob) of 8th Light and you can find the original write up from 2010 [here](http://thecleancoder.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/craftsman-62-dark-path.html). You can find out more about the London Code Dojo at its [home-page](http://www.meetup.com/London-Code-Dojo/).
